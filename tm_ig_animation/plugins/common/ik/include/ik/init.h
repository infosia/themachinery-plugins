 * @return In debug mode, assuming CSTRUCTURES_MEMORY_DEBUGGING is enabled, the
 * call to this function that reduces the refcount to 0 will return the number
 * of memory leaks detected within the ik library. Memory leaks are tracked by
 * matching every malloc() call to a free() call. Unmatched calls are reported
 * to the log and, if CSTRUCTURES_MEMORY_BACKTRACE is enabled, a stack trace to
 * where each object was allocated will be generated. It is recommended to
 * check the return value in debug mode.
 *
 * In the case that you do get leak reports, ensure you haven't forgotten to
 * delete objects anywhere, and then submit a bug report if you believe you are
 * in the right.

 *
 * If CSTRUCTURES_MEMORY_DEBUGGING is disabled, 0 is returned (default in
 * release mode).
 *
 * All other calls return 0.
