 * segment B-A then you would add a constraint to node A.
 *
 * @param[in] constraint The constraint object. The node gains ownership of
 * the constraint and is responsible for its deallocation. If the node already
 * owns a constraint, then the new constraint is ignored and an error code is
 * returned.
 * @param[in] node The child of the node you wish to constrain.
 * @return Returns IK_ALREADY_HAS_ATTACHMENT if the target node already has
 * a constraint attached. IK_OK if otherwise.
